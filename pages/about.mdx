## Work Experience

I am a Senior product designer at Revolut, where I work with the Expansion department to bring Revolut to the world. 
Apart fromt the expansion department I am also a part of the design operations team where we build internal products to optimise internal workflows.

In addition to my day-to-day responsibilities, I am also committed to giving back to the design community. I have been developing Figma plugins,
creating design resources, and speaking at design conferences to share my knowledge and experience.

Before Revolut, I was at Zomato where I helped develop multiple products like Grocery delivery ( now Blinkit), order tracking system and much more.

Before that, I was at Expedia helping build the Car rental product. I was also a part of the Expedia design systems team building internal tools and frameworks.

I got my first real taste of product design at MakeMyTrip where I was part of their app redesign followed by Hike Messenger where I worked on building India's first social chat app.
