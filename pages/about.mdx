In addition to my day-to-day responsibilities, I am also committed to giving back to the design community. I have been developing Figma plugins, creating design resources, and speaking at design conferences to share my knowledge and experience.

Before Revolut, I was at Zomato an Indian Food tech unicorn where I worked on scaling multiple products lines and implementing an ecosystem for Gig worker to work and earn with zomato.

Before that, I was at Expedia (worlds larget online travel company) helping build the Car rental product. I was also a part of the Expedia design systems team building internal tools and frameworks.

I got my first real taste of product design at MakeMyTrip followed by Hike Messenger where I worked on a multiple product lines building features.
