# About Me




## Work Experience

I am a Senior product designer at [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/), where I work with the Expansion department to bring Revolut to the world. 
Apart fromt the expansion department I am also a part of the design operations team where we build internal products to optimise internal workflows.

In addition to my day-to-day responsibilities, I am also committed to giving back to the design community. I have been developing [Figma Plugins](https://www.figma.com/@tushar) ,
creating design resources, and speaking at [Config](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhXXEM1_aP4&t=55s&ab_channel=Figma) Design conferences to share my knowledge and experience.

Before Revolut, I was at [Zomato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zomato) where I helped develop multiple products like Grocery delivery (now [Blinkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkit)), order tracking system and much more.

Before that, I was at [Expedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia_Group) helping build the Car rental product. I was also a part of the Expedia design systems team building internal tools and frameworks.

I got my first real taste of product design at [MakeMyTrip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MakeMyTrip) where I was part of their app redesign followed by [Hike Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hike_Messenger) where I worked on building India's first social chat app.


## My Skills

## My life outside of work

I was born in New Delhi India, in the early 90's and then grew up in a boarding school in mussorie which is a hill station in the Himalyas. I am a bit introverted but once I open up its hard to keep me shut.
I like to spend my free time reading Fantasy books or listening to music from th 90s, watching old movies and travelling with my wife.
