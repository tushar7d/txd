# Enhancing Car Rental Experience

## Introduction

Expedia, one of the world's leading online travel agencies. In this case study, we will explore how Expedia improved their rental car booking
flow. 

## Problem Statement
Expedia users struggled to differentiate between car rental options from the same vendor with similar names and features
but differing prices. 

This confusion often led users to assume that Expedia was showing different prices for identical cars, damaging their trust in 
the platform. 

The challenge was to present the information in a way that helped users understand why these cars had different prices and make well-informed
choices while improving their confidence in Expedia.

## Objectives

1. **Enhance User Trust**: Rebuild user trust by providing transparent and consistent information about car rental options.
2. **Improve User Understanding**: Help users understand the reasons behind the price variations for seemingly identical car options.
3. **Encourage Informed Decisions**: Assist users in making informed choices by highlighting the differences and advantages of each car.
4. **Optimize User Experience**: Redesign car selection cards for a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Solution

### Approach 1

**Upfront Approach**
This Approach shows all the options directly on the search result card. All the options are stacked one below the other the cheapest option on top.

### Approach 2

**Modal Approach**
This Approach shows the cheapest option upfront(with a dedicated reserve button) on the Search result card while all the options can be viewed
inside a modal by tapping on the "see all rates" button. All the options are stacked one below the other,  the cheapest option on top.

### Approach 3
**Dithered Approach**
This Approach shows the option on the Details page as opposed to the search result card on the other 2 options. The cheapest option is shown on the
bottom bar. and can directly be reserved from there itself. Additional options can either be seen by scrolling down the page to the options card
or by tapping on the "see all rates" button on the bottom bar.
