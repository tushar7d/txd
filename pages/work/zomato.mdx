# A brief walkthrough of the solution

## 1. Reducing user anxiety about the status of their order.

For reducing user anxiety, we tried two approaches. A/B testing and user interviews helped us decide on a winning approach. The following is a brief overview of the two approaches that we used.

### **Approach 1 (Winner)**

In this approach, we used bold colours and typography to suggest the status of the order, by using existing colours associations (for instance, green is perceived as positive).


### **Approach 2**

In this approach, we used progressive disclosure to call out the precise state that the order is in. So the user knows on a micro-level what is happening with their order. This approach did not work out for us as it was negatively impacting our matrices like ORS (orders requiring support) and Order cancellation.



## 2. Help users build trust in the system.

We believe that transparency is essential when it comes to building trust, so we are very committed to being as open as we can regarding the status of the order.

We ensured that all stakeholders responsible for delivering our food to our users communicate their status on an individual basis, so the user will always know exactly where their order stands.

Below are a few examples from the Delivery Partner and Restaurant communication

## 3. Creating a modular system for scalability

All the designs have been created with modularity and scalability in mind and have been scaled to all of our LOBs
