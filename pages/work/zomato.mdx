# Zomato Order Tracker

## Introduction 

Zomato is India's largest food delivery platform, with millions of users ordering food every day.
As a Senior Product Designer, I was tasked with Redesigning the order tracker from scratch.


## Problem

Based on analysis of support chats and internal tracking matrices we identified 2 user problems we
wanted to solve with this redesign
- ðŸ‘‰ Reducing user anxiety about the status of their order.
- ðŸ‘‰ Help users build trust in the system.

Additionally we wanted to make the order tracker scalabe to support new product offerings such as
Grocery delivery, and Medicine Delivery. 


## Solutions

### Approach 1
This approach focused on simplicity and communicating the order status with
elegant conversational copy and color association.


#### Design details

### Approach 2
This approach focused on complete transperency and showed a detailed tracker accesible through 
progressive disclosure.

#### Design details

## Outcome
We did a A/B test for the both approahches vs the old tracker over a period of a months accross 
our standard segments.The matrices we were comparing them against were Orders requiring 
support(ORS) and order cancellation.

Approach 1 was a clear winner for us. with an improvement of 27% less Orders requiring support
and 16% less cancellations 

On the other hand Approach 2 was performing worse than the old tracker with an uptake of 4% on 
the ORS

As of now Approach 1 is currently Live and is now the new order tracker for Zomato.

## Scalability
We designed both the approaches to be scalable. The entire system is build using components,
autolayout and variants with 1:1 mapping to code, here are a few examples.
