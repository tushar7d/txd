# Revolut Snap

## Context

Revolut, a prominent financial services provider, offers a wide range of features through its mobile application. Ensuring the quality and consistency of the app across various devices, territories, and user scenarios is paramount. Traditional methods of testing and verification were insufficient, and reliance on Figma files for design and functionality validation was proving to be problematic due to update delays.

## Problem

- The financial app's complexity demanded extensive testing, making it challenging to examine various scenarios across test devices and live accounts.

- Figma files, used for design reference, were not always up to date, leading to discrepancies between design and actual implementation.

- Localization issues were difficult to identify, impacting the app's user experience and compliance with various regional regulations.

## Solution

To address these challenges, an in-house web application was developed as a comprehensive solution:

- **Versatile Web App**: A web-based tool was created, allowing users to examine any flow, for any territory, on any supported device, with support for different screen sizes and platforms.

- **Dark Mode and Light Mode Support**: The tool accommodated both dark and light modes, offering users a realistic representation of the app in different environments.

- **Source of Truth**: The web application became the single source of truth, providing a real-time representation of the app's status and behavior.

- **Integrated Testing Environment**: The tool allowed internal teams to perform controlled testing, eliminating the need for live accounts, and enabling extensive scenario analysis.

- **Localization Checks**: The application was designed to help identify localization issues, ensuring a seamless user experience across diverse territories.

## Outcome

The implementation of this in-house tool had a profound impact on Revolut's app maintenance and quality assurance:

- **Enhanced Quality**: The web application served as a dependable source of truth, ensuring that all stakeholders had access to the most current and accurate information about the app.

- **Streamlined Workflow**: Designers, product owners, and internal operations teams found the tool invaluable in their daily workflow, reducing the reliance on outdated Figma files.

- **Improved Localization**: Localization issues were identified and addressed promptly, leading to a better user experience and regulatory compliance across territories.

- **Reduced Testing Challenges**: Testing and scenario analysis became more manageable, reducing the complexity of quality assurance for a multifaceted financial app.

Overall, this in-house solution transformed the way Revolut's teams understood and managed their app, enhancing its quality and compliance while streamlining internal processes. It became a key asset in maintaining and improving the Revolut app, serving as a model for addressing similar challenges in the financial industry.
