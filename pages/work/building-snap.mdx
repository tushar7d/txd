# Introduction

![Snap](/snap/one.png)

Snap is an Internal tool I designed & developed to address the challenges faced by the expansion team in ensuring a consistent and
seamless user experience across different countries, languages, devices, and color modes.

This tool serves as a centralized platform, providing designers and product managers with a single source of truth for the live status
and visual representation of the app's various flows

# Context
As a member of the expansion team, the primary responsibility is to create and implement flows that seamlessly function across
diverse countries. The challenge lies in accommodating country-specific variations, language localizations, and ensuring
a cohesive design that resonates with the cultural nuances of different regions.

# Problem
The manual testing of flows for each region and language group is time-consuming and prone to oversight. Given the diverse
requirements of each country and the need for language localization, it becomes challenging to validate the design comprehensively
before launching it into the production environment.


# Solution
The key idea was to generate screenshots of the flows under various conditions, including different countries, languages, devices,
and both dark and light modes. These screenshots would serve as a visual representation of what is live on the app in the 
production environment. You would be able to view these screenshot using a web app that will allow you to change parameters such
as Device, color mode, langauge, region etc

# Conclusion
Snap has proven to be an invaluable asset for the expansion team, streamlining the testing and validation of design elements across
different countries, languages, devices, and color modes. The automated approach not only enhances efficiency but also ensures a 
more comprehensive and accurate assessment of the app


# My role
I was responsible for the Conceptilization of the product and the design + devlopment of the Frontend for the web app. I had a lot of
help from the my team engineers to help create the automations which take the screenshot and makes them available for the web app to consume.
