## Introduction
Revolut, a global fintech giant, set its sights on entering the vibrant and dynamic financial landscape of India. As a Senior Product Designer
in the Expansion department, my primary responsibility was to spearhead the creation of the Revolut India App. This endeavor presented a
unique challenge, as the Indian financial ecosystem operates under distinct regulatory frameworks compared to the global standards Revolut
had been accustomed to.

## Problem Statement
The Indian financial regulations posed a significant hurdle, demanding a thorough redesign of the existing app to align with the specific
requirements mandated by local authorities. The foremost concern was to ensure compliance with the stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) norms,
which necessitated a comprehensive overhaul of the onboarding flow.

## Challenges
1. **Divergence in Regulatory Frameworks:** Adapting to the Indian regulatory landscape, which significantly differed from global standards, required meticulous planning and execution.
2. **KYC Compliance:** Meeting the stringent KYC requirements meant rethinking the onboarding process to collect and verify user details in accordance with Indian regulations.
3. **Feature Limitations:** Due to regulatory constraints, certain features that were integral to the global version of the app couldn't be immediately implemented. This prompted the need to prioritize and create a focused, regulatory-compliant version for the Indian market.

## Solution
The redesign process was approached comprehensively, with a keen focus on compliance and user experience. The following key solutions were implemented:

1. **Onboarding Flow Redesign:** The onboarding flow was completely redesigned to align with Indian regulatory requirements for KYC details collection. This not only ensured compliance but also provided a seamless experience for users navigating through the initial setup of their accounts.
2. **Feature Prioritization:** Recognizing the regulatory hurdles, the team strategically limited the scope of the app's features. By prioritizing key functionalities and obtaining necessary approvals, a streamlined and compliant Lite version of the app was developed. This strategic move allowed for a quicker market entry, setting the stage for subsequent feature expansions as regulatory approvals were secured.
3. **User-Centric Lite Version:** Despite the limitations, the Lite version maintained Revolut's commitment to delivering a world-class user experience. Careful consideration was given to user interface and experience, ensuring that even with a reduced feature set, the app remained intuitive and user-friendly.

## Outcome
The redesigned Revolut India App successfully navigated the complex regulatory landscape of India, ensuring compliance without compromising on the core user experience. The Lite version, strategically crafted to align with regulatory approvals, facilitated a swift market entry, establishing Revolut as a player in the Indian fintech arena.

## Lessons Learned
1. **Adaptability is Key:** Navigating diverse regulatory environments requires a flexible approach. The ability to adapt to local nuances is crucial for successful market entry.
2. **Strategic Feature Rollout:** Prioritizing features based on regulatory approvals enables a phased approach to market entry, allowing for a quicker launch while ensuring compliance.
3. **User-Centric Design:** Even in a Lite version, maintaining a focus on user experience ensures that customers have a positive interaction with the product, setting the stage for future enhancements.

## Conclusion
The Revolut India App redesign stands as a testament to the adaptability and resilience of the team in overcoming regulatory challenges. By reimagining the onboarding process, strategically limiting features, and prioritizing user experience, Revolut successfully entered the Indian market, offering a tailored financial solution that complies with local regulations while upholding the brand's commitment to excellence.
