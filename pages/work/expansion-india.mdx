## Introduction
Revolut, is a global fintech giant, as a part of the expansion strategy they want to launch in India. As a Senior Product Designer
in the Expansion department, my primary responsibility was to lead the creation of the Revolut India App

## Problem Statement
1. **Divergence in Regulatory Frameworks:** Adapting to the Indian regulatory landscape, which significantly differed from global
 standards, required meticulous planning and execution.
 
3. **Feature Limitations:** Due to regulatory constraints, certain features that were integral to the global version of the app
 couldn't be immediately implemented. This prompted the need to prioritize and create a focused, regulatory-compliant version for the Indian market.

## Solution
The redesign process was approached comprehensively, with a keen focus on compliance and user experience. The following key 
solutions were implemented:

1. **Onboarding Flow Redesign:** The onboarding flow was completely redesigned to align with Indian regulatory requirements 
for KYC details collection. This not only ensured compliance but also provided a seamless experience for users navigating through 
the initial setup of their accounts.

2. **Feature Prioritization:** Recognizing the regulatory hurdles, the team strategically limited the scope of the app's features.
 By prioritizing key functionalities and obtaining necessary approvals, a streamlined and compliant Lite version of the app was
  developed. This strategic move allowed for a quicker market entry, setting the stage for subsequent feature expansions as 
  regulatory approvals were secured.

## Outcome
The redesigned Revolut India App is has been approved by the regulators for External tetsing and Validation which is a major
milestone towards launching Revolut in India.
