description: How structuring our Figma files in a consistent way has improved collaboration and efficiency

# The context
Each individual is unique and has a specific working style. It reflects in how they do things, how they name files, structure their work.

Now, Imagine a team of 10 people working collaboratively across multiple projects, across different timezones on a tool (Figma) which allows you to do this in realtime on the same design file.

Things can get messy pretty fast.


# The Solution
The solution is pretty straightforward, Conventions and standards.

So the idea is very simple each file will have the same basic structure and will use the same page naming conventions across every project. The structure should be flexible enough to accommodate different projects.

I created a Figma plugin which does just that.


Every time anyone creates a project just run the plugin, it will generate the structure for you.

Now, this plugin is optimized for our team's workflow but you can easily modify it and use it to create a plugin of your own.

Here is the source code

Would love to know what you guys think. Looking forward to the comments.
